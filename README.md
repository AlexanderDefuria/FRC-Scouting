## Welcome to GitHub Pages

The web server is hosted from a raspberry pi during competition which creates a PAN network, (Bluetooth network) to allow other devices to connect to the web server. Using a wifi network would be much better but would be a violation of rule C05 of the [FRC Event Rules Manual](https://firstfrc.blob.core.windows.net/frc2019/EventRules/EventRulesManual.pdf), bluetooth setup of this scouting system is not a violation of rule C05 as the wording is specific to WiFi wireless bands and standards. [Community interpretation](https://www.reddit.com/r/FRC/comments/67c7z4/bluetooth_at_competitions/) also supports the legality of using bluetooth networks in the stands.
